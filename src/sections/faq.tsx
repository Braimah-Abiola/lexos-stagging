                                Yes, you can do a virtual walkthrough on your computer, except instead of taking photos you will have to upload them. We recommend using your phone for an added level of convenience.

                                When you start a new inventory from your Dashboard, you can either schedule a Guided Survey or begin one immediately.

If you schedule it for later, you&apos;ll receive a calendar invite by email with the call details.
